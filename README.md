# Network Info

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of a NetworkTypeDetector library in multiple languages (Java, JavaScript, Python). The library detects the network type (1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G) and whether the connection is mobile data or Wi-Fi. It works in various environments that support the respective APIs or libraries.

## Directory Structure

- **Java**: Contains the Java implementation.
- **JavaScript**: Contains the JavaScript implementation.
- **Python**: Contains the Python implementation.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Usage

Each directory contains specific instructions and examples for using the NetworkTypeDetector in that language environment.

- **Java**: Navigate to `Java/net/sabbir28/info/NetworkTypeDetector.java` for the Java implementation.
- **JavaScript**: `JavaScript/NetworkTypeDetector.js` contains the JavaScript library. Use `JavaScript/index.html` for a basic HTML example.
- **Python**: The Python implementation can be found in `Python/NetInfo.py`.

## Installation and Dependencies

- **Java**: No additional dependencies beyond a Java development environment.
- **JavaScript**: No installation needed beyond a compatible browser with `navigator.connection` support.
- **Python**: Install `netifaces` for Python dependency using `pip install netifaces`.

## Examples

Each language directory (`Java`, `JavaScript`, `Python`) contains examples of usage within their respective README files.
